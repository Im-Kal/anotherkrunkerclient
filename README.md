The be-all and end-all Krunker client.  
All good features from other clients crammed into one neat, fast package.

## Things to do

- [ ] Everything in the feature tracking [issue](https://github.com/asger-finding/anotherkrunkerclient/issues/1#issue-1167443624).
- [ ] Terser minification
- [ ] Sass instead of CSS

## Supported operating systems

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

Note: Use node v14.xx, or electron-acrylic-window won't compile with electron-builder. This is an oversight on the their end, and is being adressed in an issue [here](https://github.com/Seo-Rii/electron-acrylic-window/issues/85).
