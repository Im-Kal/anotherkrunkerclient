The be-all and end-all Krunker client.  
All good features from other clients crammed into one neat, fast package.

## Supported operating systems

* Windows 10
* Windows 11

Note: Use node v14.xx, or electron-acrylic-window won't compile with electron-builder. This is an oversight on the their end, and is being adressed in an issue [here](https://github.com/Seo-Rii/electron-acrylic-window/issues/85).
